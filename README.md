## Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

### Introduction
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns.
The task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.

### Objective
Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The task is to perform an initial data and exploratory
analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.


### Key Questions
* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times
when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
orders.
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.

### Data
I’ll work with a customer data set (created and included for the purpose of this project). While each data set contains a different kind of information, they all include some kind of common identifier. (NOTE: However, you’ll receive links to each data set in the Exercise content, as well.)
